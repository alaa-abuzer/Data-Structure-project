# Data-Structure-project :It is a transportation project between cities and the method of finding the lowest fare for transportation between cities,
This uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the lowest fare
There is a text file that includes entering a sample of cities and the fare between them.
And I tested it in  project.java and found the lowest fare between any two cities according to user input.
